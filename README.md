# Advent Of Code 2021
Extremely fun initiative that you can check out over [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

From the [about page](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about):
>Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

Here I'm trying to solve the puzzles and learn Python.
